Summery: About two years ago, my brother began to professionally engage in programming, and then he began to actively integrate me into this area. At first, I was not particularly interested in working on a computer, I spent more time on sports, but after a while, I looked at programming from a different angle, before it was boring for me to write code, until I realized that this was an interesting way to solve all kinds of problems in compliance with the logic. I went to university where the emphasis was on studying C ++ and I liked everything, but with some time, I decided to try myself in a different role. I watched a rather large number of videos and heard a lot of opinions about web development, after which I got a burning desire to try myself in this role. At the moment, my goal is to finish the courses and further advance in the field of Internet developer.
