        <li><h2>summery :</h2>  About two years ago, my brother began to professionally
             engage in programming, and then he began to actively integrate
              me into this area. At first, I was not particularly interested in 
              working on a computer, I spent more time on sports, but after a while, 
              I looked at programming from a different angle, before it was boring 
              for me to write code, until I realized that this was an interesting way 
              to solve all kinds of problems in compliance with the logic. I went 
              to university where the emphasis was on studying C ++ and I liked everything, 
              but with some time, I decided to try myself in a different role. I watched a 
              rather large number of videos and heard a lot of opinions about web development, 
              after which I got a burning desire to try myself in this role. At the moment, 
            my goal is to finish the courses and further advance in the field of Web development.</li>
